This will happen if your game isn't in the list. (other than the GameID precursor coming up as not found, this was a half unpacked file as i ran out of room on the HDD)
The last game renamed will show as the next (Missing from GAMEID) games title - it won't rename it though. 
Example pictured.
IF this happens the game isn't in the list, you can just rename these ones manually - or update the GAMEID


Short and simple - if you double click ps2.exe instead of using command line, you won't see the debug info at all. You will just have files that aren't renamed -  they weren't on the list.
